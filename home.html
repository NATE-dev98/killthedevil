        <h1>Introduction to html</h1>
        <p>I was watching Arcane yesterday and had a twisted story which I could not comprehend what was happening in the anime.</p>
        <h2>Forever young</h2>
        <p>I was happy to see that I will forever be young while doing what I can to make my life nice and smooth.</p>
        <h3>Kiss me</h3>
        <p>With the song "Kiss me," I almost kissed myself in the mirror so many times. All I want for Christmas is you to the blue moon and back again till I'm able to view the world.</p>
        <h5>Hosting</h5>
        <p>Over the weekend, I hosted a website on TiinySite. Using TiinySite to host my site was straightforward. I had to get the HTML file into a zip file, find a domain name (the URL), and simply host it. After that, it was live and accessible. I had a bit of help from Google, ChatGPT... I wanted to use YouTube, but I wasn't understanding.</p>
